            <p>I build, design, think, play and fiddle. At the moment I am a freelance designer and developer working on the Squarespace platform.  I am pursuing a position as a designer/developer to help hone and advance not only my current set of skills but to also learn what I don't know, grow as a developer from seasoned professionals and help be a part of something creative and bold.</p>

            <p>I enjoy projects that award me hands on work; that require problem-solving.  But I also love structure and planning and have a hyper eye for details.  As a child I would build exhaustingly detailed dioramas and miniatures. As it goes "the devil is in the details" and I'm going to make sure that last bracket or semi-colon or pixel is perfect.</p>
            
            <p>Although I'm by my lonesome at the moment, I do favor working with a team.  What you learn, you learn faster and more of and the results are more impressive. I think that is why I love playing music.  Collaboration will create something far better than a single mind ever could.</p>
